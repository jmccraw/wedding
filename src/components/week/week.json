In the AFC, the Ravens had Andy Reid on the ropes, holding Patrick Mahomes’ offense to 10 points in three and a half quarters. But the reigning Super Bowl MVP drives late and hits Mecole Hardman for the game-winning touchdown."

But Jackson will need to wait another year to reach the Super Bowl, as Andy Reid is piecing together quite a run in Kansas City early in Mahomes’ career. And while we won’t see Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski win it all in a non-Pats uniform, you have to tip your cap to the impressive run out of a wild-card spot from Dallas. Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy gets reputation rehabilitation after a sour ending in Green Bay, and Dak Prescott’s bet on himself is going to pay out … huge."

        "It’s a repeat! The Chiefs blow out the Cowboys in a lopsided Super Bowl, 42-17, and it’s time to talk full-on dynasty in Kansas City. Mahomes drops four touchdowns and, to no one’s surprise, wins Super Bowl MVP again. The Cowboys’ offense sputters out in the end, and Ezekiel Elliott is held under 50 rushing yards after Dallas falls behind quickly. Andy Reid, once thought of as a coach that couldn’t win the big one, has secured his place as one of the greats in NFL history."
