    "Sorry, NFL fans. We&rsquo;re about to spoil the 2020 season.",
    "Each preseason, we run 20,000 simulations of the entire slate with <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/fpi\">ESPN&rsquo;s Football Power Index (FPI)</a>, our projection system. A lot goes into it, including expected starting quarterback, past performance, returning starters and projected win totals. The culmination is a strength rating for all 32 teams that helps us predict outcomes.",
    "But today, only one of those sims matters: No. 3,869. We played out that single result across every game, giving us tight division races, QB controversies, breakouts and of course a Super Bowl LV champion. We also baked in NFL analyst Mike Clay&rsquo;s player projections to give us stat leaders throughout the season.",
    "Some creative license went into the storylines, and yes, this is just one of the 20,000 outcomes we found. But the season will ultimately happen only one way, and this is the one we chose to explore. Let&rsquo;s dive into Week 1."
